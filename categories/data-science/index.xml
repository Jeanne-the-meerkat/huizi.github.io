      <description>I absolutely love music! Spotify is my go-to app when I want to enjoy some listening. As someone who’s passionate about mining data and discover the story underneath, what’s great is that for each song, Spotify stores a list of its features such as acousticness, danceability, energy and more. Also, thanks to the {spotifyr} package by Charlie Thompson, we can easily use a web API by Spotify from which I can download very interesting data and play with it.</description>
