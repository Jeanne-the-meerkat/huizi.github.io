Here is a picture of me and my cat, Snowflake. Well, when she was still a snowflake. Now we call her Snowball, or ball of snow, or snow bald, for she's so big now! Anyway, I love my cat!

Besides my cat, I also love my violin! Music is my biggest hobby, growing up playing violin and now it's part of me.

I always wanted a Mini Cooper ever since I was a kid. My dream came true when I got one that's in pepperwhite! I drive it everywhere, it helps me exploring a bigger world.
