      <description>The Little Prince is one of my favorite books as a kid.
The writer meets a little prince when his plane crashed into Sahara, and he is from a planet far away. He has a rose that he really loves and takes care of, while a fox wants to be tamed by him. These are the two little stories in the book that touches my heart the most.
The rose is silly and naive, and she exaggerates her emotions to get more attention.</description>
