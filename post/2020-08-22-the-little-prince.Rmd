*The Little Prince* is one of my favorite books as a kid. 

The writer meets a little prince when his plane crashed into Sahara, and the little prince is from a planet far away. He has a rose that he really loves and takes care of, while a fox wants to be tamed by him. These are the two little stories in the book that touches my heart the most.

The rose is silly and naive, and she exaggerates her emotions to get more attention. But when the little prince decided to leave the home planet to explore a bigger world, she apologized and refused the glass cover the little prince provided, insisting that she could take care of herself. This story reminds me of young people in love. We are too focused on the appearance and what your lover say, but what's important is who we are and what we do for each other.  

The fox, on the other hand, is mature and caring. When the little prince was sad that the rose was not really the only one in the universe, the fox said, *"It’s the time that you spent on your rose that makes your rose so important. You become responsible for what you’ve tamed."* By being tamed, ordinary and mundane things becomes special and unique, yet when apart, it also leads to tears and loneliness. But in the end, *"and I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat"*, which brings back the thought of you. The world then becomes more meaningful.
